# AgglomerativeClustering
Hierarchical clustering model

Agglomerative clustering is a hierarchical clustering technique used in data mining and machine learning to group similar objects into clusters. 
It starts by considering each data point as a separate cluster and then iteratively merges the closest clusters based on a chosen distance metric until a single cluster containing all data points is formed.

Hierarchical-based clustering is typically used on hierarchical data, for example, from a company database or taxonomies. 
It builds a tree of clusters so everything is organized from the top down. Kinda restrictive, but can work well on specific datasets.
